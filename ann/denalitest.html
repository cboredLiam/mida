      <p>You input the combination into the combination lock of the folder, and the force field behind the pedestal disappears.</p>
      <p>You walk close to the portal. This is it. The portal's size and might is intimidating, but you know you have to push through.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p> 
      <p></p>  
      <p></p>  
      <p>You continue walking to the portal.</p>
      <p>...</p> 
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>   
      <p></p>    
      <p></p>  
      <p>You walk some more, but you realize you should have reached the portal by now. Maybe the snow, or whatever this snow-like sediment is, is slowing you down.</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p></p>
      <p>It feels as if the portal keeps moving away from you. Or in fact, the whole area is moving away somehow. You notice the trees seem to have barely moved in the back.</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p></p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>You stop and decide to look around the area to not tire yourself out.</p>  
      <p>There is a folder a few meters to your left that reads "Key".</p> 
      <p>Meanwhile, to your right is a wooden crate with a bulky lock. Despite being made out of wood, it looks sturdy enough to not be easily opened.</p>
      <p></p>  
      <p>Actually, you recently notice, you can only see the left half of the portal. Somehow, no matter how hard you try, you can't see the other half of the portal. How peculiar.</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>You ponder what to do.</p>
