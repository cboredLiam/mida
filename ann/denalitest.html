      <p>You input the combination into the combination lock of the folder, and the force field behind the pedestal disappears.</p>
      <p>You walk close to the portal. This is it. The portal's size and might is intimidating, but you know you have to push through.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p></p>  
      <p>You continue walking to the portal.</p>
      <p>...</p> 
      <p>...</p>   
      <p></p>  
      <p>You walk some more, but you realize you should have reached the portal by now. Maybe the snow, or whatever this snow-like sediment is, is slowing you down.</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p></p>
      <p>It feels as if the portal keeps moving away from you. Or in fact, the whole area is moving away somehow. You notice the trees seem to have barely moved in the back.</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p></p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>You stop and decide to look around the area to not tire yourself out.</p>  
      <p></p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>There is a thin folder a few meters to your left that reads "Key" on its front cover.</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>Meanwhile, to your right is a metal box with a ridge that signifies the separation of the box's base and lid. The lid can't be easily opened. Maybe further inspection is needed.</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>Then, under a layer of the snow-like sediment in front of you is a...</p>
      <p>it's a...     
      <p>Its...</p>
      <p>...something?</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>For some reason, you can't make out what it is? You can't even seem to guess in your thoughts what this <i>thing</i> is.</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>Lastly, some sort of panel is embedded in the ground near the portal. It looks out of place in this foresty area.</p>
      <p></p>  
      <p>Actually, you just noticed, you can only see the left half of the portal. Somehow, no matter how hard you try, you can't see the other half of the portal in your periphery. How peculiar.</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>You ponder on what to do.</p>  
      <p></p>
